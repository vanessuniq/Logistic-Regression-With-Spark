# Logistic Regression on Titanic and Low Birth Weight Data

This project was completed as part of the University of Maryland Global Campus Data Analytics Program, for the DATA 650 class (Intro to Big Data Analysis).

The task involved creating Logistic Regression models using Spark on IBM Cloud to analyze two datasets: a Titanic survivors dataset, and a low birth weight infants dataset. The first part of the analysis involves using logistic regression to categorize Titanic victims based on whether they survived. The second part of the analysis involves using logistic regression to predict whether babies will be born with low birth weight. The models were evaluated using measures like confusion matrix and area under the ROC curve.
